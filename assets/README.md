now # Assets Directory

This directory should contain test replay files for the examples.

## Required Files

- `test.osr` - A valid osu! replay file for testing the library

## How to get a test replay file

1. Play any map in osu! 
2. Go to your osu! folder (usually `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\osu!\Data\r\`)
3. Find a recent `.osr` file 
4. Copy it to this `assets/` directory and rename it to `test.osr`

Alternatively, you can download replay files from:
- osu! website (replay downloads)
- Replay databases
- Community shared replays

## Note

The example will display an error message if `test.osr` is not found, guiding you to place a valid file here.
